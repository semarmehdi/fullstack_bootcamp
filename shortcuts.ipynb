    "\n",
    "- mkdir dirname: Create a new directory\n",
    "- touch filename: Create a new empty file\n",
    "- open filename: Open filename with the default software related to its extension\n",
    "- cp existing_file new_file: Copy existing_file into new_file. Both existing_file and new_file can include paths (relatively to your working directory). For example, cp ../file1.ipynb folder1/file2.ipynb will create a copy of file1.ipynb which is stored in the parent directory of your working directory, and save it into folder1/ directory which is located in your working directory, by renaming it file2.ipynb.\n",
    "- mv existing_file new_location: Move existing_file to new_location. You can use paths in the same way as with the cp command. For example, mv file1.py folder1/file1.py will move file1.py into folder1. You can also use this command to rename files, for example : mv file1.md README.md will rename file1.md into README.md\n",
    "### NB : all the commands listed above will be executed relatively to your working directory. You can know at any time in which directory you are with the pwd command, and use cd to change your working directory."
